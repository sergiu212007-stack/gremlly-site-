        <h2>Our&nbsp;Origin</h2>
        <p>GREMLY was born out of a desire to break the typical cycle of hype tokens. Instead of chasing unrealistic promises, GREMLY embraces the chaos of markets with a calm smile. Our digital gremlin lives on the TON blockchain, flicking the switch when FOMO gets too loud.</p>

        <h2>The&nbsp;Story</h2>
        <p>GREMLY came to life when its creators decided to make a token that thrives on authenticity. Our mascot gremlin – mischievous yet lovable – reflects the unpredictable nature of crypto. GREMLY doesn’t instruct you when to buy or sell. It observes, adapts and enjoys the journey.</p>
